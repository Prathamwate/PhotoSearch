## Task Description

The task required me to use the Unsplash API to search for car images using a specific query. The API URL provided was:
[Unsplash API URL](https://api.unsplash.com/search/photos?page=1&query=car&client_id=Your_Access_Key)

### Functionalities Used

To complete this task, I used the following JavaScript functionalities:

1. **Fetching Data from an API**: I used the `fetch` function to make an HTTP request to the Unsplash API and retrieve the list of car images.

2. **DOM Manipulation**: I manipulated the DOM to display the retrieved images on the webpage. I used JavaScript to create and append HTML elements dynamically.

3. **Event Listeners**: I added event listeners to specific elements to handle user interactions. For example, I added a click event listener to each image to allow users to view the image in full size or perform other actions.

## How I Accomplished the Task

Here is a brief overview of how I accomplished the task:

1. I obtained an access key from Unsplash by signing up for their API access.

2. I used the `fetch` function to make a GET request to the Unsplash API using the provided URL with my access key.

3. Once I received the response from the API, I parsed the JSON data to extract the list of car images.

4. I dynamically created HTML elements to display the retrieved images on the webpage, ensuring they are properly formatted and styled.

5. I added event listeners to the images to provide interactivity, such as showing a larger version of the image when clicked.

6. Finally, I hosted the project on a web server to provide a hosted link for submission.
